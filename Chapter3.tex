\chapter{Analysis and Design of Intelligent Traffic Management System}

Modern traffic systems face dynamic and unpredictable congestion patterns, where fixed-timing signals often cause long delays and disrupt efficient vehicle flow. To tackle this issue, our project introduces an intelligent traffic management system powered by IoT and machine learning technologies. Ultrasonic sensors are deployed to continuously measure the distance to vehicles, providing real-time estimates of traffic density. Additionally, cameras at intersections capture live video, which is processed using computer vision techniques to detect and count vehicles.

This information is fed into a machine learning model trained to analyse traffic patterns and recommend optimized signal timings, enabling smarter and more responsive traffic control. Based on real-time traffic density, the system dynamically adjusts traffic light durations to ensure smoother vehicle flow and reduced congestion. Unlike traditional systems that operate on fixed timers, our solution offers adaptive control, greater accuracy, and scalability. By integrating IoT and machine learning, the system can intelligently respond to changing traffic conditions, enhancing road safety, minimizing delays, and providing a cost-effective upgrade to existing traffic infrastructure.

\section{Methodology}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deploy ultrasonic and IR sensors strategically on key traffic lanes to capture real-time data on vehicle presence and proximity for accurate traffic density estimation. In the absence of vehicle detection, the system defaults to a round-robin signal rotation to maintain continuous traffic flow.

\item Capture live video streams using high-resolution cameras and apply image processing algorithms (e.g., OpenCV with YOLOv5 or SSD) for object detection, vehicle classification, and emergency vehicle identification.

\item Train and integrate a supervised machine learning model (e.g., decision tree or random forest) using historical and real-time sensor and image data to dynamically predict traffic flow patterns.

\item Implement a microcontroller-based control unit using the ATmega2560 and ESP8266 to adjust traffic signal durations dynamically based on real-time traffic analysis.

\item Integrate priority logic for emergency vehicle detection using camera-based object tracking or RF modules, enabling immediate green signal override through GPIO-controlled signal relays.

\item Develop a web-based dashboard using Flask/Django for backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend to display live traffic data and congestion levels from each direction.

\item Simulate and test the system using traffic scenario emulators or custom simulation environments to evaluate responsiveness, accuracy, and prioritization efficiency.

\item Calibrate and optimize system parameters through iterative testing and performance analysis to ensure low latency, accurate detection, and robust signal control under varying traffic conditions.
